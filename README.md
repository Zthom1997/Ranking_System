# Ranking_System
This Ranking System is developed for an school asessment. 

For an annual event at Zuyd College there had to 
be made a Ranking System because there were made many errors with keeping up the scores of participants. 
This Ranking System is developed in Python which will be used to prevent these errors and to give all
participants during the event an overview of their scores.

Features:

- There will be made a number of folders on the C:\ drive where generated files will be saved in.
- There can be added new participants to the Ranking System.
- The scores per participant and per team can be modified and the system will automatically calculate the scores and the stand of each participant.
- After each round the system will show an overview with the current standings and scores.
- When the program is closed it shows an overview with the last standings to determine an winner.
- After each action, logfiles will be automatically created and saved to the folders created on the C:\-drive to store the data
